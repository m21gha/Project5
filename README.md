# Project5

by Megha, Pavlin, Bhupesh

Note: 
Please have the necessary .bag files for the project. (The .bag files are too large to upload to github)
This includes:
- CalibNew_360.bag
- Modelnew1_360.bag

Please also download this NPV file reader from this public sourced github. 
https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab
(This is needed for coordinatetransformation function in Project5.m)

The getdepthdata is a ros package that was created by Megha Martin to capture and save all the depth data whilst the Modelnew1_360.bag is running.

RUN PROJECT5.M to SEE THE RESULTS!
